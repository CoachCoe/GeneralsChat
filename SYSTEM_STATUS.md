# System Status & Verification Report

**Date:** November 2, 2025
**Test Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

## ✅ Enhanced Chatbot Behavior - VERIFIED

The chatbot successfully demonstrates all requested behaviors:

### 1. **Gathers Information from Users** ✅

**Test:** Vague incident report ("A student was bullied today")

**Response:**
```
I need to gather some key details to provide you with the proper compliance guidance.
Let me start with the most critical information:

What specifically happened during the bullying incident?

Please describe the specific behaviors or actions that occurred (e.g., physical contact,
verbal statements, exclusion, cyberbullying, etc.).
```

**Result:** Chatbot asks ONE clarifying question at a time, exactly as designed.

---

### 2. **Asks Smart Clarifying Questions** ✅

**Test:** Detailed fight with injury

**Response:**
```
First, the most urgent question: Has any medical attention been provided to Student B
for the bloody nose, and do they need to see the nurse or require any further medical
evaluation?

Once we address the immediate medical needs, I'll need to understand a few more details...
```

**Result:** Chatbot prioritizes by urgency (medical attention first), then asks follow-up questions.

---

### 3. **Provides Suggestions on Incident Type & Next Steps** ✅

**Test:** Title IX incident (inappropriate touching)

**Classification:**
- **Type:** Title IX
- **Severity:** High
- **Required Actions:** DCYF mandatory reporting, parent notification, investigation

**Response:**
```
First, the most urgent question: Has this incident already been reported to DCYF
(Division for Children, Youth and Families)?

This type of allegation typically requires mandatory reporting within specific
timeframes...
```

**Result:** Chatbot correctly identifies incident type and asks about mandatory reporting requirements.

---

### 4. **Uses Policies from Vector Database** ✅

The RAG system successfully retrieves relevant policy chunks for each query:
- Bullying incidents → DISC-001 Bullying Prevention Policy
- Bus conduct → Policy JICC Student Conduct on School Buses
- Sexual harassment → Title IX Policy Update 2025

## 🚀 Next Steps: Batch Policy Upload

### Option 1: Manual Upload via UI (Recommended for MVP)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/policies
2. Click "Upload Policy"
3. Fill in:
   - **Title:** Policy code and name (e.g., "JLDBB - Suicide Prevention")
   - **Policy Type:** Select from dropdown (e.g., `suicide_prevention`)
   - **Effective Date:** Date policy went into effect
   - **File:** Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT file
4. Click "Submit"

### Option 2: Batch Upload Script
Use the template in `POLICY_MAPPING.md` (lines 117-188) to upload multiple policies at once.

**Steps:**
1. Save all policy documents as `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files in `sample-policies/`
2. Name consistently: `policy-code-description.pdf` (e.g., `jlf-mandatory-reporting.pdf`)
3. Create batch upload script with policy details
4. Run: `npx tsx scripts/upload-policy-batch.ts`

### Option 3: Direct API Upload (for testing)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/policies \
  -F "title=JLDBB - Suicide Prevention" \
  -F "policyType=suicide_prevention" \
  -F "effectiveDate=2024-01-01" \
  -F "file=@sample-policies/suicide-prevention.pdf"
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

**To complete the system:**

1. **Immediate (Today):**
   - Upload Priority 1 policies (Suicide Prevention, Mandatory Reporting, Restraint/Seclusion)
   - These have the most urgent compliance requirements

2. **Short-term (This Week):**
   - Upload Priority 2-3 policies (Discrimination, FERPA, School Safety, Emergency Ops)
   - These are frequently referenced in incident investigations

3. **Medium-term (Next Sprint):**
   - Upload Priority 4-6 policies (Student Conduct, Health, Administrative)
   - These provide comprehensive coverage for all incident types

**The chatbot is ready and working perfectly. Once you add the remaining policies, the system will have complete coverage of your compliance framework!**
